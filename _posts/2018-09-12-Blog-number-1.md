    <td>I could have done more work when we were working on our github pages because I am not a code master as you may now so leaving it for when I get home was a big mistake. Not only do I struggle on harder bits when I tried to change the text colour I somehow ended up breaking the whole page which also broke my confidence. </td>

    <td>Next time I should probably ask for help instead of trying to look for help online where they were all a bit further ahead than changing the colour of their text. After finally figuring out what to do I decided  to bundle all the code in at once and now I realise that was the worst thing I could of done. Not only were there hundreds of people logged on to the school wifi making it extremely slow, github was clearly not ready for the amount of code I was trying to give them. So I won't be surprised if this blog looks hideous.</td>
